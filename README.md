# WhiteBoardChallenges
This was the task I received after ProblemSolvingPartTwo from devCodeCamp
Steps of the software development process:
1. Based on a given starting point (feature, task, code block, etc.), what is the 
expected end result?
2. What are the written-out steps to go from point A to point B? You need to 
solve the problem before you begin coding it.
3. Implementation (coding it out, researching)
4. Test and debug code (run code with breakpoint, unit test, etc.)
5. Refactor if necessary. Test again. This continues until functionality is 
solidified.
The above steps should be rinse and repeated for every single problem you 
encounter. Ignoring these steps or straying from them will result in the long way 
around to solving a problem or even possibly never solving the problem. 
To be a good problem solver, it is important to be able to break problems down. 
One way to go about this is to write out the steps it will take to solve the problem. 
These steps are written down in English in a manner that are easily explainable to 
someone who may not be technical. The idea is that in order to code something out,
you first need to have a good understanding of what it is you are attempting to 
solve. For each of the problems below, write out the steps it will take to go about 
solving the problem. Then code it out and test!
You may jump around in these problems. If you get stuck on one problem, begin 
working on another. If you get stuck on that new problem, go back to working on 
the previous one. 
The use cases below are just examples to give you a better idea of what might be 
passed into the method or what might be outputted from the method. You shouldn’t
be coding exactly to these examples, but rather, be flexible to handle any data of 
that data type.

Whiteboard Challenges
1. Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they 
add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would 
have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
a. Use Case:
i. Given numbers in an array: [5, 17, 77, 50] 
ii. Target: 55

2. Palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as 
forward i.e. madam. Write code that takes a user input and checks to see if it 
is a Palindrome and reports the result. You must handle spaces. 

3. Given a list of integers, return a bool that represents whether or not all 
integers in the list can form a sequence of incrementing integers
a. Use case: 
i. {5, 7, 3, 8, 6}  false (no 4 to complete the sequence)
ii. {17, 15, 20, 19, 21, 16, 18}  true

4. Create a method that takes an array of positive and negative numbers. 
Return an array where the first element is the count of the positive numbers 
and the second element is the sum of negative numbers. 
a. Use case: [7, 9, -3, -32, 107, -1, 36, 95, -14, -99, 21]

5. Create a method that accepts a string of space separated numbers and 
returns the highest and lowest number as a string
a. Use case: “3 9 0 1 4 8 10 2”  “0 10”

6. Create a method that accepts a string, check if it’s a valid email address and 
returns either true or false depending on the valuation. Think about what is 
necessary to have a valid email address.
a. Use case:
i. “mike1@gmail.com”  true
ii. “gmail.com”  false

7. Create a method that takes in a string and replaces each letter with its 
appropriate position in the alphabet and returns the string
a. Use case:
i. “abc”  “1 2 3”
ii. “coding is fun”  “3 15 4 9 14 7 9 19 6 21 14”

8. A briefcase has a four-digit rolling-lock. Each digit is a number from 0-9 that 
can be rolled either forwards or backwards. Write a method that returns the 
smallest number of turns it takes to transform the lock from current 
combination to the target combination. One turn is equivalent to rolling a 
number forwards or backwards by one. 
a. Use case: 
i. Current lock: 3893
ii. Target lock: 5296
9. Given a number, return the reciprocal of the reverse of the original number, 
as a double. 
a. Use case: If given 17, return 0.01408 (1/71)
